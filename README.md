Google Homepage Clone

Attempting to create a non-working version of the Google homepage using html, css, and node.js. Hope to get a better idea of how all the elements work in web development and more comfort in each aspect of development. Will not be attempting to implement a working search bar or any of the hover animations/ effects.
